## Description

The assignment solution consists of an HTML file (`index.html`) and an external CSS file (`css/style.css`). The webpage is designed to be responsive, adapting its layout based on the screen size of the device. It displays three food items: Chicken, Beef, and Sushi, along with their descriptions.

## Setup

To view the webpage locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The webpage will display the "Our Menu" heading and three sections, each representing a food item (Chicken, Beef, and Sushi). The sections will be displayed side by side on larger screens and in a single column on smaller screens.

The background color and text color of the "Chicken" and "Beef" sections differ from that of the "Sushi" section. The "Sushi" section also changes the text color to red in the "Tablet View" as specified in the CSS.
